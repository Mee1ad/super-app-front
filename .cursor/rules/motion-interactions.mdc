# ðŸ’  Motion & Interactions

## Framer Motion Standards (MANDATORY)

* Use Framer Motion only (no raw CSS transitions)
* All animations: duration under 300ms
* Use spring where appropriate
* Smooth, subtle scaling for tap/hover

## Example Implementation:

```tsx
<motion.div 
  whileHover={{ backgroundColor: "rgba(0,0,0,0.02)" }} 
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }} 
  transition={{ duration: 0.15, ease: "easeOut" }} 
/>
```

## Interaction Requirements:

* Use consistent easing/duration across FABs, modals
* Haptic-like feedback through subtle scale/opacity changes
* All interactions must include visual feedback (hover, click, tap)
* Global hover and click animations for all openable items
