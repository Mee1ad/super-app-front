# ðŸ–‹ UX Copy & Microcopy

## Copy Standards:

* Use concise, action-driven language
* Avoid jargon; make errors and actions clear
* Buttons: use verbs ("Save", "Retry", "Delete")
* Use empty state text as onboarding help

## Localization Requirements (MANDATORY):

* Copy must be localized and accessible
* Use i18n-ready keys instead of inline strings
* Avoid hardcoded dates, numbers, or currencies
* All user-facing strings must be translatable
* Pluralization and gender-aware phrasing must be supported where needed

## Empty States:

* Display empty state text in correct place with proper padding and margin
* Provide helpful guidance and clear CTAs
* Use empty states as onboarding opportunities

## Error Messages:

* Descriptive error states with retry actions or diagnostics
* Show only error toast notifications (no success toasts)
* Provide clear next steps for users

## Persian Text Support:

* Use Vazir font for Persian text instead of Iran Sans
* Ensure proper RTL support where needed
